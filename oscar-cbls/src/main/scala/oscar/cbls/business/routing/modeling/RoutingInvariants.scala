   * The distance computed by this invariant considers the values o the diagonal as part of the cost (node cost are added to the distance)
   *
   * This invariant relies on the vehicle model assumption:
   * there are v vehicles
   * They are supposed to start from point of values 0 to v-1
   * These values must always be present in the sequence in increasing order
   * they cannot be included within a moved segment
   *
   * @param routes the routes of all the vehicles
   * @param n
   * @param v the number of vehicles in the model
   * @param perVehicle true if you request the distance per vehicle (slower)
   *                   false if you want the total distance among all vehicles
   * @param distanceMatrix the matrix of distance
   * @param distanceIsSymmetric true if you swear that the distance matrix is symmetric, false and it will be considered as asymmetric (slower!)
   * @param precomputeFW performs forward pre-computation, only useful if multiple vehicle and per vehicle distance or asymetric matrix
   * @param precomputeBW performs backward pre-computation, only useful if assymetric matrix
   * @return if the distance is PerVehicle, it is an array that maps each vehicle to its drive distance
   *         if the distance is global, it is a array with a single variable that is equal to the sum of all drive distance
