/**
 * This package proposes dedicated routing neighborhoods and invariants.
 *
 * it represents the routes as a single sequence and everyting in this pacage relies on the routing assumption, which is stated as follows:
 * - there are v vehicles
 * - They are supposed to start from point of values 0 to v-1
 * - These values must always be present in the sequence in increasing order
 * - They cannot be included within a moved segment
 *
 * Tt defines a type that is a VRP. it only packs a sequence variable and , which is set at the beginning of all optimization
