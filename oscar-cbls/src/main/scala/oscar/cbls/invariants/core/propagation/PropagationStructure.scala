/**
 * This class manages propagation among propagation elements.
 *
 * This class is intended to be extended, and the overriding class must implement
 * the method getPropagationElements that returns the propagation elements to be considered
 * Each propagation element has a UniqueID. Those should be assigned continuously starting from 0.
 *
 * It is to be used as follows: once the set of propagation elements is stabilized,
 * one must call setupPropagationStructure, which will built the necessary internal data structure
 * propagation are triggered by calling the propagate method.
 * additionally, before calling setupPropagationStructure, the method registerForPartialPropagation can be
 * called to specify propagation elements that might require lazy propagation.
 *
 *  Two debug mechanisms are provided: trace printing and debug mode.
 *
 *  A trace printing is provided; the propagation structure prints a trace of what it is propagating.
 *  This is activated by the Verbose parameter. All prints are preceded by ''PropagationStruture''
 *  This an be useful when checking the behavior of partial propagation.
 *
 *  A self-check method is called by the propagation structure after propagation is performed.
 *  This is activated by the Checker parameter.
 *  You should ensure that Asteroid is compiled with assert activated if you are using the debug mode.
 *  It will considerably slow down Asteroid, as other checks are implemented in the base modules.
 *
 *  Also, although this propagation structure is intended to support acyclic graph
 *  for the static dependency graph, you can deactivate the associated mechanism
 *  by setting the IsAcyclic graph to true.
 *  If unsure, set to false (or do not set; it is false by default),
 *  the engine will discover it by itself. See also method isAcyclic to query a propagation structure.
 *
 * @param verbose requires that the propagation structure prints a trace of what it is doing.
 * @param checker set a Some[Checker] top check all internal properties of invariants after propagation, set to None for regular execution
 * @param noCycle is to be set to true only if the static dependency graph is acyclic.
 * @param topologicalSort if true, use topological sort, false, use distance to input, and associated faster heap data structure
 * @param sortScc true if SCC should be sorted, false otherwise. Set to true, unless you know what your are doing. Setting to false might provide a speedup, but propagation will not be single pass on SCC anymore
