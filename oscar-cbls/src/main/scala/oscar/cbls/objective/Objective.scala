/**
 * a common class for modeling an objective, and querying its variations on different basic moves
 *
 * All queries on the variation on the objective following moves are performed
 * by explicitly performing the move, evaluating the objective, and backtracking the move.
 *
 * hence all these queries return the value of the objective function after the move, and not a delta
 * as you will find in Comet for instance.
 *
 * The reason is that this value is computed through explicit state change and restore,
 * and since all moves are performed lazily,
 * computing a delta would not enable OscaR.cbls to perform the state restore
 * and the next state change in a single model propagation
 * (you generally call a bunch of such methods in a row to find the move you want to perform actually)
 * hence it would be much less efficient to compute a delta at this level than computing a value.
 *
 * If you need a delta, you should compute it by yourself.
