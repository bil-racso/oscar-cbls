   * inserts a non routed point, and removes a routed point

   * @param neighborhoodName the name of this neighborhood
   * @param best should we search for the best move or the first move?
   * @param symmetryClassesOnInsert a function that input the ID of an unrouted node and returns a symmetry class;

   * @param predecessorsOfRoutedPointsToRemove: the predecessors of the points that we will try to remove, inactive if samePlace
   * @param hotRestartOnInsert set to true fo a hot restart for the insertion, with symmetry elimination if present (hot restart on the point to insert, not the position)
   * @param hotRestartOnRemove true if hotRestart is needed, false otherwise
   * @param maximalIntermediaryDegradation the maximal degradation for the intermediary step. Typically set it to Int.MaxValue-1
