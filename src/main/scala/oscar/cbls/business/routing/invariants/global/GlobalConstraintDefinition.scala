/**
  * This abstract class must be extends in order to define a new global constraint.
  *
  * It uses a parameterized type U that represents the output type of your constraint
  * (for instance for RouteLength output value is of type Long (the total distance))
  *
  * It's associated to a GlobalConstraintCore (gc) by adding gc.register(this) at the beginning of your constraint.
  *
  * The following methods must be implemented :
  *     - performPreCompute
  *         --> A method that computes some stuff in order to evaluate the value of a vehicle the fastest possible
  *         --> Can be slow (only performed after a move is accepted)
  *     - computeVehicleValue
  *         --> A method that computes the value of a vehicle given a an explored movement (as a List of Segment)
  *         --> Must be as fast as possible (using your precomputed values)
  *     - assignVehicleValue
  *         --> Update your output variable (ex: routeLength(vehicle) := value)
  *     - computeVehicleValueFromScratch
  *         --> A naive method that computes the value of a vehicle given the route of the problem (IntSequence)
  *         --> Must be correct for it's used for debugging purpose (as the good value)
  *
  * How does it works ?
  *     The GlobalConstraintCore (gc) associated with this global constraint manages all the process of the global constraint :
  *       - Converting route's moves into segment
  *       - Calling the right method at the right time
  *       - ...
  *     When you implement a new global constraint you just need to implements the four methods above and
  *     associate this constraint to the GlobalConstraintCore (gc.register(this)) it does the rest.
  *
  * @param gc The GlobalConstraintCore you want to associate this constraint to
  * @param v The number of vehicle
