package oscar.cbls.core

/** This package proposes the mechanics to model objective functions.
 * It basically offers some neighborhood evaluation methods that use the partial propagation
 * proposed by [[oscar.cbls.core.computation.Store]].
 * It features the [[oscar.cbls.core.objective.IntVarObjective]] class to model an objective in a problem statement, and
 * the [[oscar.cbls.core.objective.Objective]] to use in other classes.
