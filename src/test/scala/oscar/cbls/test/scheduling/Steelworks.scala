/**
 * A simple model of a steelworks.
 * 
 * Steelers have five tasks to achieve:
 * - iron making (needs 2 steelers)
 * - steel making (needs 3 steelers)
 * - casting (needs 1 steeler)
 * - roughing rolling (needs 2 steelers)
 * - product rolling (needs 2 steelers)
 * 
 * There is five steelers, with different work hours :
 * - from 5AM to 12AM (1 steeler)
 * - from 8AM to 5PM, with one hour to eat between 12AM and 14PM (3 steelers)
 * - from 2PM to 9PM (2 steelers)
 * 
 * Iron making and then steel making must be achieved in the same day.
 * Roughing rolling and then product rolling, must be achieved in the same day.
